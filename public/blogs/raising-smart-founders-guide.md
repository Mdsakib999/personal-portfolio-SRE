## Start with alignment, not valuation

Fundraising is a long-term relationship. We prioritized investor alignment (vision, expectations, network) over short-term headline valuation — and it paid off.

## The prep work you actually need

- **Runway model:** build a 12–18 month plan with base, upside, and downside scenarios.
- **Milestones:** define 3 clear milestones that trigger the next funding round.
- **Story + proof:** a one-pager that ties market, traction, and use of funds.

## Term sheet red flags

- Overly strict control terms (board control, vetoes).
- Aggressive liquidation preferences that punish founders on exit.
- Vague milestone definitions tied to funding tranches.

## Negotiation tips

- Prioritize clauses that protect founder flexibility and hiring ability.
- Get term sheet counsel early — a small fee now can avoid big headaches later.
- Use simple models to show dilution under multiple rounds.

## TL;DR

Raise for the runway you need and the investor partner you want — not just the biggest check.

## Quick actions

- Build a transparent 18-month runway.
- Draft clear milestones before meetings.
- Run term sheet scenarios with cap table impacts.
