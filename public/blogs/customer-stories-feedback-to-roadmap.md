## Start small, listen loudly

Customer feedback can be noise if you don’t structure it. We built a simple feedback funnel and used it to prioritize a feature that improved retention.

## The funnel

1. **Capture:** in-app prompts + NPS + support tags.
2. **Quantify:** tag feedback by impact (revenue/retention/ops) and frequency.
3. **Test:** build small prototypes and validate with the reporting cohort.
4. **Ship & measure:** track retention lift and engagement.

## Case: the feature that mattered

Customers repeatedly asked for a tiny automation. It looked minor, but after prioritization and a two-week prototype we shipped an MVP and saw a measurable retention bump — the ROI was immediate.

## Framework for prioritizing

- **Impact x Effort matrix** but with a twist: add a “confidence” score. Higher confidence accelerates delivery even if impact is medium.

## TL;DR

A repeatable feedback funnel turns scattered requests into measurable roadmap decisions.

## Actionable playbook

- Build a simple tagging system for feedback.
- Run one small prototype per month.
- Measure impact on a specific metric (e.g., 7-day retention).
