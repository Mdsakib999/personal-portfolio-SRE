## Why I changed how we hire

Talent is expensive. Bad hires cost even more. We realized technical skill is table stakes — culture fit and learning ability determine long-term impact.

## New hiring playbook

- **Screen for mindset, not just keywords.** We ask about learning loops and examples where candidates changed their mind after data.
- **Work samples over whiteboard puzzles.** Real tasks mirror day-to-day work and reveal how someone thinks under real constraints.
- **Panel interviews with stakeholders.** Cross-functional input reduces bias and highlights collaboration skills.

## The payoff

- Onboarding time dropped ~50% because new hires understood decision-making norms and documentation culture.
- Cross-team collaboration improved — fewer handoffs, faster iterations.

## Practical interviews questions we use

- “Tell me about an assumption you were wrong about. How did you find out?”
- “Show a tiny project you shipped and the metrics you tracked.”
- “How do you ask for feedback?”

## TL;DR

Hire for curiosity, clarity, and feedback loop skills — technical skills can be trained.

## Quick checklist to steal

- Replace one technical screen with a work sample.
- Add a values-fit question to every interview.
- Require hiring manager + peer sign-off.
