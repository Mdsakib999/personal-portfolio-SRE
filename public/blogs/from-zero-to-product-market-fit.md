## Intro — quick vibes

Shipping fast beats debating forever. In our first year we focused on one thing: validate whether real people would pay for the problem we wanted to solve. That decision changed everything — product choices, hiring, and our pitch to investors.

## The problem

We had a hypothesis: busy pros need a simpler way to do X. But a hypothesis is not proof. Building a perfect product without proof wastes time and money.

## What we actually did

- **Week 1–8:** Built an MVP that solved the absolute core problem (no fluff).
- **Week 3–16:** Did 200 user interviews and 100 usability sessions. We asked: “Would you pay for this?” — not “Do you like it?”
- **Metrics we tracked:** activation rate, 7-day retention, NPS snippets, and conversion from free → paid.
- **Iterate & kill:** Features that didn't move the needle were deprioritized or axed.

## Results

- MVP → first 1,000 users in ~5 months (mostly organic + targeted outreach).
- Identified one core segment (customers who pay fast) and focused roadmap on them.
- Early pricing experiment increased conversion by ~20% (quantified via A/B tests).

## What I learned

1. Build the smallest thing that answers whether users will pay.
2. Customer conversations are product research — treat them like data.
3. Ship, measure, iterate. Numbers > opinions.

## TL;DR

MVP + targeted user interviews + clear metrics = faster product-market fit. Don’t overengineer; validate first.

## Actionable steps

- Pick 3 core metrics before you build.
- Run 20 real paid-conversion experiments in the first 3 months.
- Commit to killing one ‘nice-to-have’ feature every sprint.
